# merl
A useless python library. Developed using the code.org IDE, because why not.

Not sure how to actually make it a library so give me some time.

## Functions
### printanim(msg)
Prints 'msg' where 'msg' is a string. If 'msg' does not have spaces, then it all prints at once. Else, it prints word-by-word.

### replyPrint(prompt)
Where 'prompt' is a string. This has Merl reply whatever, based on what you put in. Expect "I don't know." to show up more than once.
